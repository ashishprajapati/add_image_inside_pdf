# AddImageInsidePdf - Replace any text with image in PDF files

This gem is very efficient for the case when we need to replace any text with image within the pdfs. This gem also allows to replace multiple texts with any image in single call.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'add_image_inside_pdf'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install add_image_inside_pdf

## Usage

	# Replace single text with the image [ height should be a number ]
	AddImageInsidePdf.replace_text_by_image(pdf_file_path, 'string_to_replace', image_local_path, height)
	AddImageInsidePdf.replace_text_by_image("sample1.pdf", "IMAGE PLACEHOLDER", "image.jpg", 20)
	
	# Replace all required text with the image
	AddImageInsidePdf.replace_all_text_by_image(pdf_file_path, ['string1', 'string2'], image_local_path, height)
	AddImageInsidePdf.replace_all_text_by_image("sample2.pdf", ["image1", "image2", "image3"], "image.jpg", 20)

	# Height parameter is optional so if you will ignore height parameter then it will take 20 automatically
	AddImageInsidePdf.replace_text_by_image("sample3.pdf", "IMAGE PLACEHOLDER", "image.jpg")
